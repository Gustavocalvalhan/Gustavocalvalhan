#### About me
Hi, I'm Gusutavo Calvalhan and I'm living in Tallinn.


Nowadays, I am studying programming because its was my passion since university when I need to learn Java. I would like to work with this, at the moment I am studying Scala. 

 With more than 3 years of professional experience in the field of marketing and digital production. In 2019, I developed the project to create the marketing agency MG Insights, where I am currently CEO. I have experience in creating digital content and managing social networks, focusing on optimization results in capturing and interacting with consumer users and greater visibility of the client's brand.

In addition, I also have skills in entrepreneurship through the formation of business partnerships, focusing on improving the activities developed by companies so that, later, there is a negotiation of purchase and sale of brands.

Throughout my professional career, I have also had professional opportunities abroad, especially in Japan, which have improved not only my multilingual skills, but also my professional skills to think outside the box, high-level customer contact, leadership, business orientation, creativity and attention to details.

As a marketing professional, I have experience using technological tools such as Adobe Premiere, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, Facebook ADS, Google ADS, Photography and Filmmaker.
